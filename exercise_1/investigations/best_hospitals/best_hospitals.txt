The results above show the top 10 hospitals (ordered by average effective care score) that have at least 1 "Better than National Rate" readmission rate. I chose to incorporate both the Readmissions data as well as the Effective Care data to ensure both facets of Hospital quality were assessed. I believe that these results are consistant in showing 10 hospitals with high average effective care rates as well as being able to deliver low readmission rates. I believe this is a good model to show high-quality care.
